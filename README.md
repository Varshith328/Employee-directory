   - Navigate between pages using the page numbers or arrow buttons

## 🎨 Design Features

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 768px (single column layout)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (two column layout)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (three column layout)

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Blue (#3B82F6) for main actions and highlights
- **Secondary**: Gray tones for text and borders
- **Success**: Green for positive actions
- **Danger**: Red for delete actions and errors

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects on cards and buttons
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Loading states and feedback messages
- Focus indicators for accessibility

## 🧪 Data Management

### Local Storage
The application uses in-memory storage for employee data. All changes persist during the session but reset when the page is refreshed. This simulates a backend API without requiring server setup.

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: All form fields are required
- **Email Format**: Validates proper email format using regex
- **Duplicate Prevention**: UI prevents accidental duplicate submissions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages guide users to correct issues

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Departments or Roles
Edit the `src/data/mockEmployees.ts` file to modify the available options:

```typescript
export const departments = ['HR', 'IT', 'Finance', 'Marketing', 'Sales'];
export const roles = ['Manager', 'Developer', 'Analyst', 'Coordinator'];
```

### Modifying Employee Fields
To add new fields:
1. Update the `Employee` interface in `src/types/Employee.ts`
2. Add validation rules in `src/utils/validation.ts`
3. Update the form component in `src/components/EmployeeForm.tsx`
4. Modify the employee card display in `src/components/EmployeeCard.tsx`

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses React.memo and proper dependency arrays
- **Data Processing**: Optimized filtering, sorting, and pagination algorithms
- **Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking enabled for minimal bundle size
- **Code Splitting**: Ready for route-based code splitting if needed

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements with More Time
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to a real API with persistent storage
2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Employee profile pictures and detailed information
   - Bulk operations (import/export CSV)
   - Advanced reporting and analytics
   - Employee hierarchy and organization charts
3. **Enhanced UX**:
   - Drag-and-drop sorting
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Dark mode support
   - Offline capability with service workers
4. **Performance**:
   - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Optimistic updates
   - Background sync

### Known Limitations
- Data doesn't persist across browser sessions (by design for this demo)
- Limited to predefined departments and roles
- No user authentication or role-based permissions
- No real-time collaboration features

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
